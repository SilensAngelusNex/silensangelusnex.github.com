Today was an easy 15 miles past the White Rocks Cliffs. I finished around 3pm and just sat in the shelter munching on trail mix and reading. I'm almost done book four of [The Hyperion Cantos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00CKD3ZIY/ref=dp_st_0553283685). I've got The Dark Tower queued up on my Kindle, but I think I'd rather find something different. If only so I go through reading material slower, I need to start doing some longer days, but the town and shelter spacing hasn't been conducive so far.

### Day 42 - July 11
---

Today's hike was a fairly short 14 miles into Manchester Center, a little town with way more designer clothing shops than its size seems to warrant. I was in the clouds the whole morning going over Peru Peak and Bromley Mountain. There's a nice outfitter in town called the Mountain Goat, where I got some [permethrin](http://www.tickencounter.org/prevention/permethrin) that I'm going to treat my clothes with tonight after I wash them.

The next place I stop to resupply is probably going to be [North Adams](https://www.google.com/maps/place/North+Adams,+MA+01247/@42.6834881,-73.1883318,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e0b789e5ea50eb:0x4e63876b3bcc94ed!8m2!3d42.700915!4d-73.1087148) in three days. It's getting harder to find hostels to stay at in town as I work my way south, so I might start going into town, buying food, and getting back on the trail without staying anywhere. After North Adams, I'll hit [Sheffield](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sheffield,+UK/@53.3956347,-1.6395383,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48790aa9fae8be15:0x3e2827f5af06b078!8m2!3d53.381129!4d-1.470085) about four days later.

My new water filter, the [Sawyer Mini](https://sawyer.com/products/sawyer-mini-filter/) is working fine using the gravity feed method that **El Burro** (the hiker formerly known as Sam) was using when we were in Maine. I'll have to get a picture of it. Anyway, I was planing on upgrading to the [Sawyer Squeeze](https://sawyer.com/products/sawyer-squeeze-filter-system-sp131/) at the outfitter here but decided against it.
