Finally out of Virginia! I've got less than a quarter left to go (about 75 miles less). After the climb out of Damascus, today was mostly nice ridgewalking, which was fortunate for me. **Nature Boy** left town at 8:30 this morning (He had to wait for the Post Office to open.), but I had to wait for the library to open at 9:00, then spend two hours writing last time's post. I got in to the campsite **NB** picked out at 7:30, about 15 minutes before dark, so I had to cook and eat by the light of my headlamp. The things I do for you guys.

### Day 112 - September 19

Another long day today. At least this one was because of the miles I put in instead of a late start. The ridgewalking continued for a while, then we went down into a valley and walked across Watauga Dam and around the corresponding lake. Next came Pond Mountain, the worst PUD (Pointless Up and Down) since the northeast. The trail spiralled up 2k ft over three miles, then spiralled right back down. There was a great view of the underside of the treetops at the summit. I found **Nature Boy's** stealth site a bit earlier today, but it was still pitch black before I finished eating.

This morning, **Nature Boy's** food bag (with one day of food in it) wasn't heavy enough to come down from the tree when he untied it, so he had to climb straight up the tree to get it back. I guess the fact that he was successful means he didn't pick a very safe spot to hang it. I'm starting to think bears are just an elaborate hoax, especially since none have disturbed my bear canister (or maybe they're just good about putting it back). Later today, we caught up to a Flip-flopper, **Dancing Bear**, who's going to try to roll with us for a while. Maybe he's not real either.

Rob, a trail angel and former hostel owner who **Nature Boy** and I met up in Massachusetts, shuttled us into Roan Mountain (the town) for breakfast this morning. We ate at Bob's Dairyland, went across the street to the small grocery to resupply, then Rob took us back to the trailhead. Today's hike was hugely mountainous, culminating with Roan Mountain at 6212 feet. Afterwards, we met Rob again, went to dinner at Golden Corral (I feel like I cheated since I didn't run any 4k repeats beforehand.) and stayed the night at Rob's house. He offered to pick us again if we do 29 miles tomorrow, but we aren't planning on going quite that far. We've been working hard the last few days.

Well, we ended up doing that 29 miles anyway. We got to the campsite where we'd planned to stay, then decided to do the 3 miles into Erwin, TN, so that we could stay at Uncle Johnny's Hostel there.Â  Once we got there, we met Twisted, another SOBO. Its his 7th tome hiking the AT; he's a character. He mist have spent 20 minutes ranting about the hike over Pond Mountain. It wasn't always a never-ending spiral apparently. I'm not sure if I want him to keep up with us.

There's more of this post to come, but I don't have time to type it in at the moment. Stay tuned!
