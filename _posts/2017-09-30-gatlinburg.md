The whole post is here now! Sorry about the long delay.

### Day 111 - September 18

Finally out of Virginia! I've got less than a quarter left to go (about 75 miles less). After the climb out of Damascus, today was mostly nice ridgewalking, which was fortunate for me. **Nature Boy** left town at 8:30 this morning (He had to wait for the Post Office to open.), but I had to wait for the library to open at 9:00, then spend two hours writing last time's post. I got in to the campsite **NB** picked out at 7:30, about 15 minutes before dark, so I had to cook and eat by the light of my headlamp. The things I do for you guys.

### Day 112 - September 19

Another long day today. At least this one was because of the miles I put in instead of a late start. The ridgewalking continued for a while, then we went down into a valley and walked across Watauga Dam and around the corresponding lake. Next came Pond Mountain, the worst PUD (Pointless Up and Down) since the northeast. The trail spiralled up 2k ft over three miles, then spiralled right back down. There was a great view of the underside of the treetops at the summit. I found **Nature Boy's** stealth site a bit earlier today, but it was still pitch black before I finished eating.

### Day 113 - September 20

This morning, **Nature Boy's** food bag (with one day of food in it) wasn't heavy enough to come down from the tree when he untied it, so he had to climb straight up the tree to get it back. I guess the fact that he was successful means he didn't pick a very safe spot to hang it. I'm starting to think bears are just an elaborate hoax, especially since none have disturbed my bear canister (or maybe they're just good about putting it back). Later today, we caught up to a Flip-flopper, **Dancing Bear**, who's going to try to roll with us for a while. Maybe he's not real either.

### Day 114 - September 21

Rob, a trail angel and former hostel owner who **Nature Boy** and I met up in Massachusetts, shuttled us into Roan Mountain (the town) for breakfast this morning. We ate at Bob's Dairyland, went across the street to the small grocery to resupply, then Rob took us back to the trailhead. Today's hike was hugely mountainous, culminating with Roan Mountain at 6212 feet. Afterwards, we met Rob again, went to dinner at Golden Corral (I feel like I cheated since I didn't run any 4k repeats beforehand.) and stayed the night at Rob's house. He offered to pick us again if we do 29 miles tomorrow, but we aren't planning on going quite that far. We've been working hard the last few days.

Well, we ended up doing that 29 miles anyway. We got to the campsite where we'd planned to stay, then decided to do the 3 miles into Erwin, TN, so that we could stay at Uncle Johnny's Hostel there.Â  Once we got there, we met Twisted, another SOBO. It's his 7th time hiking the AT; he's a character. He mist have spent 20 minutes ranting about the hike over Pond Mountain. It wasn't always a never-ending spiral apparently. I'm not sure if I want him to keep up with us.

### Day 116 - September 23

Tons of climbing today. It looks like it's going to be that way for a while, judging by the guidebook. We kept a solid pace today; I got to eat before dark for a change, even though the water source was a quarter mile away.

### Day 117 - September 24
---

We had an adventure and a fun lesson in property rights today. **Nature Boy** and ** Dancing Bear** found two dogs walking on the trail, both of which were looking like they'd been out in the woods for a while. Their owners were nowhere to be found, and no one answered when we called the phone number on the dogs' tags. **Nature Boy** and ** Dancing Bear** used their bear ropes to leash the dogs and take them with us. A bit later, we called the hostel in Hot Springs to make reservation and ask if there was an animal control or something that could take the dogs. The hostel owner told us to let the dogs go, because there's a $10,000 fine for it, as it's interfering with someone's property. Awhile after they (quickly) unleashed the dogs, we passed their owners tracking their radio collars. They apparently were hunting bears and had lost the dogs.

### Day 118-119 - September 25-26

Today we had a comparatively short hike into Hot Springs. There were a lot of day hikers, which was perplexing since it was Monday. After we dropped our packs at the hostel, **Nature Boy**, **Dancing Bear** and I went and got gigantic burgers at the Smokey Mountain Diner. We then had to hit all three places that sold food to piece together a resupply. The next day I did a lot of reading, played some pool (or billiards or something) at the BBQ place where we ate lunch, then went back to chill at the hostel. I was all set to do my post on the hostel' s computer, when I realized that what I had thought was a computer was, in fact, a bunch of disconnected parts without a CPU. Bit hard to use one of those. All in all, though, it was a relaxing and well-deserved zero. Less than two weeks to go!

### Day 120 - September 27

Up out of Hot Springs and back into the mountains! We camped on the bald top of Max Patch tonight. It's only a half-mile hike from the nearest parking lot, so there were a lot of people up there to watch the sunset with us. One of the groups was a band who seemed to be filming a music video, so we had these girls singing Fire and the Flood in the background all evening. All these non-hiker people are *weird*.

### Day 121 - September 28
---

When we were starting off today, we met a southbound section-hiker who delivered some bad news: the shelter where we'd planned on staying is closed for bear activity. Our alternative options were to go 16 miles or 31 miles. **Nature Boy** and I were pretty disappointed. Right before we got into the Smokies we went down to the lowest elevation we've hit in a week or so; I'm glad we're not doing the whole 5000 foot climb up into the park in one day. Even so, the last part of the day was brutal. Since the day was so short, we got into the shelter early and made a fire in the built in fireplace. The shelter also has a chain-link fence to keep the bears out, which isn't the most comforting. I'd thought that the fences had been discontinued because people would feed bears through them, but apparently this shelter got skipped over.

### Day 122 - September 29

I'm so glad to be done with that climb. It only took 15 miles. The Smokies are pretty cold and foggy up on the ridge the AT follows. I was wearing shorts for the climb and was sweating anyway, but once I was up on top, I got cold quickly, even when I was walking. The shelter where we stayed tonight was a big one like last night's, but we had to share it with so many weekend hikers. We happened to hit the park at the worst time for that, right on the weekend. These guys made a fire in the fireplace and stood around talking for an hour and a half after dark. "Sir, I hiked 27 miles today and you hiked 3. Please let me go to sleep." And this is going to happen tomorrow night too, isn't it. Anyway, I'm looking forward to getting into Gatlinburg tomorrow, even though **Dancing Bear** didn't come through with his connection to get a ride.
