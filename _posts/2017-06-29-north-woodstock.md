So I'm going to try doing posts in aÂ  shorter, daily journal entry style instead of all at once so I'm not struggling to remember which pictures are which and don't have to be so frantic writing in town.

### Day 24 - June 23

The **Settlers of Katahdin** and I rolled out of the White Mountain Hostel at 11ish after watching way too many episodes of *Whose Line Is It Anyway?* there. We pretty much stayed together for the whole of the 3000 foot climb today. We managed a pretty respectable pace, even as food-laden as we are, so we're optimistic about the big 18 mile day we have planned for tomorrow through the Wildcats. I'm trying to slough weight by eating it, so I haven't been so full since... yesterday at the Chinese buffet.

### Day 25 - June 24

Today I saw more people than I think I have in any day since I started, including days in town. We walked right by a wedding on top of the Wildcats. I'm not sure who looked more out of place. 

We barely finished what we planned for today before it got dark. I got to the campsite (Osgood) at 7:30. It would have been a pretty easy day if it hadn't been for the long, steep descent 3/4 of the way through.

### Day 26 - June 25

Today started with a 2500 foot climb up to the summit of Mount Madison, then we went over the shoulder of the others until we climbed up Washington. The mountains were in the clouds most of the day, but it cleared up by the time we summited so we got some great views. We're doing a work-for-stay at the Lake of the Clouds hut, so we're going wash dishes or something. We do get to eat all the hut-goers untouched leftovers (turkey soup, stuffed shells, and salad) so I'm pretty excited about that. The plan is to stay and help clean up after breakfast so we get those leftovers too.

### Day 27 - June 26
---

Met Dad at Ethan Pond after a huge descent and a killer climb up the other side of Crawford Notch. We didn't get work-for-stay in Zealand hut (They were full with the **Settlers of Katahdin**) so we had to climb up a mile and a half to find a stealth site. I had some Deja-Vu from two nights ago. As we were setting up it started to sprinkle. It wasn't quite an ideal first day.

### Day 28 - June 27
---

Dad and I made it to the Garfield Ridge Shelter so we would only have a a 13 mi into town tomorrow. The shelter was empty when we got there, but three NOBOs and two section hikers showed up before long to get out of the rain. Among the was **Wildebeest**, a character that looked like he was straight out of Duck Dynasty. He had some pretty wild stories many of which featured him almost getting hypothermia or people encountering bears. I'm glad we stayed here just for his antics.

### Day 29-30 - June 28-29

Dad and I got into [The Notch](http://notchhostel.com) and caught up to **The Settlers** in the afternoon after a long hike in the fog and wind along the ridgeline after Mount Lafayette. We went into town to resupply and get some burgers and got to try some poutine at the burger place, which was fantastic. The nect day, Dad slackpacked the Franconia -> Kinsman section (16 miles), but we almost didn't make the pickup. We were just sauntering along when we realized, about halfway through the day, that it was going to be close and started hauling. We both made it to the parking lot with 10 minutes to stay. After we got back to the hostel, some of the people there (**Lucky** and **Bookie**) brought some cake for everyone there for my birthday. It was awesome!

I'm not really sure where I'm going to stop in and resupply next, but I've got 5ish days of food and there's a lot of towns coming up. I'll probably join back up with **The Settlers**.
