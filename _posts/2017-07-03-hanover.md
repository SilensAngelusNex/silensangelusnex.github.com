The daily entry seems good so far, but it takes a lot of phone battery. Let me know if you have any feedback.

### Day 31 - June 30

Today I did a pretty chill nine miles, partly so that **The Settlers** could catch up to me and partly because today I went over Mount Moosilauke, the steepest climb probably since Sugarloaf. The trail went up right next to a bunch of cascading waterfalls for a climb of about 2k feet in 1.5 miles. There were a bunch of sections where the trail went up near-vertical rock slabs with wooden steps nailed into them.

Everything on the way up was wet from the night before and a little slippery, so I really took my time. Going down the falls didn't look like it would be a fun time. Above treeline, the summit was cool even though the visibility was abysmal.

### Day 32 - July 1
---

Then the rains came. Today **The Settlers** and I met **The Omelette Guy**, who has a whole propane kitchen set up near Cape Moonshine Road and gives eggs (with ham, peppers, and onions), pancakes, muffins, bananas, coffee and orange juice to hikers. We stayed under his roof of tarps to stay dry for a while, then went off to climb over Mount Cube, so we could get to the hexagonal shelter (named Hexacuba Shelter) with the pentagonal privy where we planned to stay the night. We had gone about half way up when rain started coming down in buckets. We were soaked to the core by the time we made it under the shelter's roof. The AWOL guidebook said that the shelter's water source was an "unreliable stream" 0.2 miles away, but this afternoon there were several reliable streams within twenty feet, including the one coming off the shelter roof. Unbeknownst to us at the time, the rain was so bad that it washed out a number of roads in the area.

### Day 33 - July 2

Somewhat predictably, today was *wet*. Much of the trail was just a long series of deep puddles. I took a wrong turn and ended up on the Smarts Ranger Trail for a while, which was really just a 3-mile long stream bed. Once I had walked down two miles of stream and realized I was on the wrong trail, I decided that I was *not* going to hike back up. Thankfully it converged back into the AT at the parking lot at the foot of Smarts Mountain. The views from the tops of these peaks aren't as nice as the ones in the Whites, mostly because there's trees in the way, but there was a great ledge today that dropped off hundreds of feet just a few feet off the trail.

### Day 34 - July 3

Today was a pretty easy 10 miles into Hanover. It was pretty weird to pop out of the woods and end up between a road and some Dartmouth soccer fields. I resupplied for four or five days at the Co-op grocery store right by the trail and got a new cannister of propane at the hardware store. I just ran out this morning.  I downloaded Git and Atom onto a library computer so I could reorganize the blog's files and finished up the posts for the past few days. It's so nice to type on a keyboard after so long using my phone. The next order of buisness is finding a place to stay. Hanover's a bit different in that it doesn't have any hostels, but it does have a bunch of "Trail Angels" who let hikers stay overnight. I'm planning on zeroing here for the fourth, then heading on the day after. I was going to meet up with **The Settlers** today in town, but I have no idea where they are. Guess I'll find them when we're on the trail again.
