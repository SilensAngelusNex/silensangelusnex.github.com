I'm going to come clean right out of the gate here: I haven't been in to Harper's yet. I *am* in a hostel called the [HI Harpers Ferry Hostel](https://www.hiusa.org/hostels/maryland/knoxville/harpers-ferry), which is only a few miles outside. It's really in Knoxville, but that might be confusing if I actually stay in Knoxville, TN.

### Day 74 - August 12

I did make it to the Darlington Shelter like I planned, but beforehand I spent an alarmingly long time in town, mostly writing the post for you guys, but also visiting the few restaurants open Sunday morning. I packed out half of an Italian Sub and half a gallon of green tea, which turned out to be a questionable decision, since the first thing the trail does leaving Duncannon is climb up Hawk Rock. I finished both off once I got to the top. I made it to the shelter well before it got dark and didn't get caught in the impending thunderstorm, so I guess the timing actually worked out pretty well. Once I arrived, I met a guy hiking a section with his friend and two kids. He told me and **Sniffles** some stories of sketchy people he met out hiking, which kept us entertained for at least an hour while I cooked dinner. This guy would have made Mad-Eye proud with his **CONSTANT VIGILANCE** or maybe his paranoia. Which one it is depends on whether they really *are* out to get you.

### Day 75 - August 13
---

Mom and Dad came out to meet me halfway through my hike today. They really couldn't have picked a less interesting section of trail. About half of the day we spent hiking through fields and crossing roads. We did get a fair amount of shade from trees along the sides, but I'm disappointed that they didn't get to do something a little more representative of the AT. At the end of the day, I went home with them to get a good meal, sleep in my own bed, and swap out some gear (It's been cold enough at night that I want my sleeping bag again. It'll probably be stifling from now on, though.) before coming back out tomorrow. My nice trekking poles broke (just the tip, actually), so I'm leaving them at home until the company ships us the parts to fix them. In the meantime I'm going to use my dad's set.  

### Day 76 - August 14
---

I felt fat and lazy today. My pack and stomach are full of food and I've got these heavy trekking poles. On the upside, I am once again current on both Game of Thrones and Rick and Morty. It only cost a few hours of sleep. I stopped six miles earlier than I planned and turned in early. The highlight of today was Pine Grove Furnace State Park, where I remember staying for a Boy Scout trip or two and home of the half-way half-gallon challenge, which I did not attempt. I remember how that went in Hanover.

### Day 77 - August 15

1094.9 down, 1094.9 to go. That's... actually pretty intimidating to think about it that way. At least the ostensibly hardest part is behind me. I'm starting to be really concerned for the NOBOs I'm seeing. Y'all are in trouble. I'm not sure if I've mentioned this in any of the posts yet, but since New Jersey, the torrent of them I was passing has slowed to a trickle. (I think I saw 3 today.) The trail is actually getting pretty lonely. **Sniffles** is (probably) ahead of me somewhere, since I stopped early yesterday. Hopefully, I can catch him just by doing more consistent miles than he is. Otherwise, I might be in for a hell of a lot of alone time.

### Day 78 - August 16

Really not sure what to say for these days; besides the miles, they aren't too eventful. I unfortunately missed out on an opportunity to order pizza in Pen-Mar park, but they did have a bathroom that the guidebook doesn't mention (like, with running water) so I wasn't too disappointed. The shelter I stayed at (Raven Rock) was a really nice two-floor deal. I'm a sucker for the lacquered floor. The water source wasn't close, but the shelter made it worth it. I'm going to be cutting it close on food by the time I get to Harper's Ferry; all I'll have is two packs of oatmeal by then.

### Day 79 - August 17
---

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilensAngelusNex/silensangelusnex.github.com/master/_images/harpers/20170817_161507.jpg "View from a powerline slash that's *much* less interesting than the Washington Monument")

I went by the Washington Monument today, in Washington Monument State Park. But, you say, isn't that in DC? Isn't it on the Lawn? No. No, it's not. How dare you belittle the [stone beehive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument_State_Park) that the citizens of Boonsboro assembled in a flash-mob on July 4, 1827. Yeah, that's 68 years before that *other* monument with a similar name. Anyway, I remembered that I was going to take a picture of it's supreme majesty when I was a few hundred meters down the trail, so here's a picture of powerlines instead.

In other news, my food canister has not been as empty as it will be tomorrow morning since Monson, and the other guy in the shelter tonight is making Smeagol noises while he sleeps. Gollum, Gollums and everything. If he starts sleeptaking about his precious, I'm not going to bat an eye.

### Day 80 - August 18

I hiked a little with Smeagol this morning down towards the C&O canal trail. It's absurdly flat and smooth compared to the AT, but the trail down to it had almost a mile of switchbacks. It was great to hike alongside the Potomac, even if it was just for a few miles today. I really enjoy the smell for some reason. Maybe just for a change. I went up into Knoxville to get some pizza from the convenience store there before checking in to the hostel; I may have some food troubles since there isn't a grocery in Harper's Ferry. I have to go all the way to Front Royal before I get to the next one, so I'm going to have to do something more creative for resupply. If I feel lazy tomorrow I might take the train into DC and do it there, otherwise I'm going to head to another hostel twenty-some miles from here and at worst delay my problem a day.
