I'm ready to head off to Katahdin in Maine tomorrow morning. [Apparently](http://www.myweather2.com/Hill-and-Mountain/United-States-Of-America/Mount-Katahdin.aspx) it's going to be about 45F at the summit and 60F at the base. I think I'll be missing the summer weather for a while.

I'm a little worried about the food situation; I filled up my 11.5L bear vault with compact food (rice, oatmeal, peanut butter, etc.) but the total calorie count seems low unless I miscounted something. It looks like it's enough for ~7 days and the thing can't hold any more volume. I guess I'll figure it out before I restock.
