After seven days of no resupply, a two day seems almost too short. I carried three days of food I didn't need over two mountains.

After relying on a quickly-deteriorating stick for the past 80 miles, I took the opportunity to buy some trekking poles on the way out of Shaw's. I was pretty skeptical before (which is why I didn't start with any) but the poles are niiiiice. They help getting down steep rocks without killing your knees and let you fly on the flats. They took a little getting used to; I speared my shoe with them a couple times and put a big hole in it. It's fixed now, I guess.

I was really tempted to linger a little more in Monson; Matt, Sarah, and **Sriracha** were going to get some pizzas and camp at the trailhead, but I didn't want to camp out in the rain, so I pushed on to the Horeshoe Canyon Lean-to. (Which I have now learned is pronounced leAHNtoe. :p )

*Pizza....*

The next day, I went up Moxie Bald, which is the biggest climb for a single mountain since Kahtahdin. The way down was rough. Steep downhills are no fun. Great view though.

The next town on the radar is Stratton, which looks way bigger than the last two in the guidebook. I think I'm going to take an easy day on the trail tomorrow, but even so, I should be there at the end of the third day after leaving Carratunk. I might have to start skipping towns. I probably would have gone by Carratunk, but I have to wait for the ferry to get across the river and their hours are 9-11AM.
