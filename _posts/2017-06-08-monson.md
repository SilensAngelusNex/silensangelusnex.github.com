I just made it through the hundred-mile wilderness and into Monson this morning after a 3-mile hike from the Leeman Brook shelter. I got pretty lucky with my food; I would have made it into town with only one spare dinner and a half a jar of peanut butter left if I hadn't doubled up on dinner once I realized I had some food to spare. I was able to go pretty fast (15+ miles per day after the first couple days) even though the trail climbed up to a lot of little mountain peaks. Unfortunatly, it was foggy when I was at the summit of White Cap mountain, the tallest one in the wilderness, so I didn't get a great view on that one, but I got some decent ones on top of some of the others. The wind was pretty harsh up there without tree cover.

The bugs have been pretty terrible so far. Mosquitos and Black Flies are all over you whenever you stop walking. I've been setting up the my tent (without the rain fly) inside the shelters to keep them off.

We saw a handful of NOBOs who were crushing it through the wilderness to get to Katahdin. One of the other guys I've been hiking near asked one of them for some food tips, and the guy told us that he was eating 35 [bars](http://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/builder-s) a day, one bar per mile. While we were talking with him, he was taking bars out of his pack and stashing them on every pocket on his pack he could reach with it one. I think I need some more bars.

Right now, I'm staying the night at [Shaw's](http://www.shawshikerhostel.com/) and planning on taking an easy day to Horeshoe Canyon tomorrow. It should only take me 3-4 days to make it to Caratunk, where I think I'll spend the night since there's some unavoidable ferry service right after the town with only morning hours this time of year.
