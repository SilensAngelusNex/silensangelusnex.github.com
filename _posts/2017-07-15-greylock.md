Last night I met back up with **Sheriff**, (I met her at Lake of the Clouds and in Hanover.) who convinced me to try to do 27 miles to get past the Story Spring and Kid Gore shelters. We'd heard there had been some bear activity there and wanted to skip over them. I felt pretty good for the first 20 or so, but once I got to Kid Gore, 23 miles in, I was exhausted. I had plenty of daylight left to make it, but I almost fell asleep as soon as I sat down to eat my protein bar, so I decided to stay. **Sheriff** decided the same when she rolled up about a hour later. We didn't see any bears though, so I guess our plan worked anyway.

I slept in today. Yesterday really beat me up, and that it rained until 8:30 made it so easy to just stay in my sleeping bag. I still got some good miles in, but it was a little later than I'd have liked when I got in to Congdon shelter. The Glastenbury Mountain lookout tower was pretty much the highlight of the day, even though it was decently foggy up there.

Goodbye Vermont, hello Massachusetts! I crossed the line around noon today and made it into North Adams an hour or two later. There we some bikes set out for hikers to use right near the trail on the way out of town, so I hopped on one of those and enjoyed the town's amenities, including the YMCA showers, the laundromat, the grocery store, and Oriental Buffet. I found a new Ramen flavor at the Big Y supermarket: Tortilla Chicken. I think only the most authentic ramen shops must serve it, because I've never even heard of it before. Anyway, I'm relatively clean now, which is a nice change. I left town around 4pm and hiked up to the next shelter with a bunch of heavy food to eat for dinner tonight.

 I hiked the three miles up from the shelter to the top of Mount Greylock this morning. The Bascom Lodge at the top is a nice place; I got an omelette for my second breakfast there. I'm going to hang out here until my phone and Kindle are fully charged, download a few new books, then head down to the next shelter or the campsite after that. I'm going to stay at the Upper Goose Pond Shelter tomorrow night. It's supposed to be really nice, with a caretaker who makes hikea pancakes in the morning, so I figure I can't really pass that one by.
