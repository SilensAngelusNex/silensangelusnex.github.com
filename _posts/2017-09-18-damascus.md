Here's some more pictures of our time at McAfee Knob. It was frigid up there, especially considering the wind, so we didn't stay too long after sunrise. We hiked down while the overcast morning gave way to misty rain. It felt like a long hike to the Four Pines hostel for me, even though it was less than 10mi. I think when I tell myself "Its just going to be a short hike," I skew my expectations too much and it makes it drag on. Four Pines in basically a bunch of cots and couches in this guy's standalone three car garage; it's almost full tonight with our group and a handful of others who are hitting the Dragon Tooth, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs section of the trail. Ben and **BFG** went on ahead of us, (They did 27mi today.) so we probably won't see them again.
