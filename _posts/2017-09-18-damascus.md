Here's some more pictures of our time at McAfee Knob. It was frigid up there, especially considering the wind, so we didn't stay too long after sunrise. We hiked down while the overcast morning gave way to misty rain. It felt like a long hike to the Four Pines hostel for me, even though it was less than 10mi. I think when I tell myself "Its just going to be a short hike," I skew my expectations too much and it makes it drag on. Four Pines in basically a bunch of cots and couches in this guy's standalone three car garage; it's almost full tonight with our group and a handful of others who are hitting the Dragon Tooth, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs section of the trail. Ben and **BFG** went on ahead of us, (They did 27mi today.) so we probably won't see them again.

**Nature Boy** left the hostel before the rest of us today; he was getting antsy while we waited for The Homeplace to open. **Sniffles** and **Pickles** were really excited to go to the family-style all-you-can-eat restaurant. It was excellent; I'm glad I waited with them, even though it meant we had to night-hike to get to the first shelter after the hostel. After we passed Dragon's Tooth at 1930, it started getting dark fast. We all had headlamp, so we could see the trail fine, but it's still a bit nerve-racking. Getting close to the shelter we started seeing our lights glinting off groups of eyes in the woods, which had us on edge until the trail went close enough to one group for us to see that they were all deer bedding down for the night. That night was a cold one. I miss the extra warm clothes I left at home when I stopped by; I'll have to get them back before we get up into the Smokeys.

### Day 101 - September 8

Today I decided to catch up to **Nature Boy**, who stayed the night four or five miles ahead of us last night. I found two or three of his things in shelters along the way when I stopped for breaks including his guidebook; he must be unconsciously shedding weight. In the end, I did a 28.3 mile day and ended up about a mile past where **Nature Boy** camped so I could stay in a shelter. **Pickles** and **Sniffles** are still behind. The trail's profile today looked like it did in PA: up, flat, down, repeat. There were a bunch of fields, including one with the Keffer Oak, which is the oldest tree on the AT.

The flat ridgeline sections of the trail were even longer today. The hiking was fairly easy, especially since I didn't go as far as I did yesterday. The views toward the end of the day were amazing; the sunset was one of the few unobstructed ones I've seen while I'm out here. There were a few groups staying at the shelter with us, inculding a dog who kept jumping up on the table looking to eat my food. Not. A. Chance.

Today **NB** and I went in to Perisburg to resupply. Unfortunatly, it's Sunday (Again!), so I wasn't able to get any fuel for my stove and had to eat at *Dairy Queen*. I'm not sure how I came to the conclusion that I didn't like DQ, because it actually was decent fast food. Anyway, I went in to stay at Wood's Hole Hostel so I can buy fuel there. **NB** went way ahead of me, so I'll have to to a big day soon if I want to catch up. He really missed out on Wood's Hole; I got free dinner and breakfast, which were both excellent. There were vegetables!
