Sorry I posted (and have continued posting) this half-finished. I was in the middle of it, and then there was barbecue, and then I didn't have service, etc.

### Day 81 - August 19

My resupply problem is solved; Bear's Den has a pretty decent resupply with Ramen, Rice Sides, and some bars. I got a nice taste of the Rollercoaster on my way in. It's a 13 mile section of rolling hills. They're each about 500-1000 ft climbs. I'm 4 miles in now, so the first half of my day tomorrow will be rough. In other news, I found a weird bug bite or something on the back of my head. Hopefully it's a mosquito or something and I don't have Lymes. If it doesn't go away in a day or two, I'll go get it checked out when I get the chance.

### Day 82 - August 20

Weeeeeee! The rollercoaster ride is finished! The rest of the day was through some nice meadows and gentle hills. I thought I earned it. I got into a really nice shelter where a ridge runner told me and the section hiker staying there about how fire rings she breaks up keep magically reappearing and (somewhat angrily) cut down all the strings hanging from the shelter roof for people to hang packs. That night, I got woken up a hour after I fell asleep by Dad shining his headlamp in my face. He brought me my nice poles. I'm so happy.

### Day 83-84 - August 21-22
---

So I decided to take advantage of the fact that Dad's car is a mile away to head back home and get this bite checked out. My neck and the back of my head are all swelled up so I went to the doctor and got a blood test for Lymes. And might as well chill out a little while I'm at home. I probably should have posted, but I'd only have a few days on the post and I'm lazy, so...

### Day 85 - August 23
---

I got a ridiculously late start today leaving home and started hiking at ~2PM. I just did 5 miles to the shelter after the one where I stayed with Dad. There was a handful of people at the shelter tonight, including **Halfway** (the hiker formerly known as John) and his dog Blue. I thought he was way ahead of me, but Blue apparently slowed him down. It was nice to ease back into the hiking with such a short and easy day after being back.

### Day 86 - August 24

I hiked up into the Shenandoah State Park today. I haven't seen any bears yet, which is surprising given the NOBOs' stories about the park, but I have seen tons of signs about bears. I had to put a big tag on my pack that says I'm a backpacker when I crossed into the park, which I though you had to buy, but I didn't see anywhere to pay. I met back up with **Sniffles** at the shelter tonight; he said he took a couple days off back home in D.C. when he passed through Harper's Ferry.

### Day 87 - August 25

After getting in to the shelter tonight, **Sniffles** came up with two other thruhikers, one a Harper's Ferry flip-flopper, **Pickles**, and **Nature Boy**, a SOBO from Denmark. These guys laid out their plan for going through the Shenandoahs, which is more aggressive than mine (They're trying to get done by early October.) but I'm going to latch on and let them pull me along. The company should make it easier. Their plan is to get to Waynesboro in four day and includes a 26.2 day, which should be fun.


### Day 88 - August 26

Not the best morning today. I woke up with a sore throat, then, four or five miles in to the hike, a bee stung me on the ear, so I was all swelled up for a couple days. I'm fine now, no suspicious swelling or bites or anything, but I really hope these don't become a regular thing. The hiking today was pretty fast, motivated by the wayside two-thirds of the way through the day. We posted up in the restaurant there for a while, then resupplied at their little store before leaving. I got a big slice of Virginia Ham to pack out. Some of the section hikers at the shelter that night really got me worried about trichinosis while I was boiling ham pieces in my ramen (Backseat cooking, amiright?), so I cooked the rest over the fire on a stick. It turned into a bit of a group project; everyone was a bit mesmerised once the fat started dripping into the fire.

### Day 89 - August 27

Just another day in the Shenandoahs, crossinf back and forth over Skyline Drive. The trail is nice and smooth so the miles go by quickly. There have been tons of dayhikers here, too. Every time I see someone car camping, I start to wonder what the point of it is. "They're not even going anywhere. Why wouldn't they just drive home and come back in the morning?"

### Day 90 - August 28
---

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilensAngelusNex/silensangelusnex.github.com/master/_images/daleville/20170828_111817.jpg "View from Blackrock. Unfortunately, no old ship")

Today was a hell of a long one. The 26.2 that we planned ended up being more like 27 or 28 with the side trails to water sources or to the shelters where we took breaks. I did see my first interesting animal today, a bear, when it ran across the trail about 150m in front of me. It stayed in the bushes just off the trail, watching me until I yelled at it. The more stationary views were excellent today, too, especially the ones from Black Rock. There was cell service at the shelter, so I treated myself to watching the Game of Thrones finale.

### Day 91 - August 29
---

Today we left the Shenandoah State Park and headed in to Waynesboro. **Pickles** was staying with a friend of her family and the rest of us went to stay at Stanimal's 328, the hostel in town. There we met Ben, an British former PCT hiker, and **BFG** (Big Friendly German) who are both going SOBO blazingly fast. **Nature Boy**, **Sniffles**, **Pickles**, and I met up for lunch at Ming Garden Buffet, which might just be the best Chinese buffet I've ever seen. **Nature Boy** ate so much that he could barely make it back to the hostel without throwing up. The three of us staying at Stanimal's went out later to resupply then went to Domino's, placed a delivery order, and rode back to the hostel with the delivery guy. I'm still not sure if that was smart or just trashy.


### Day 92 - August 30

We hiked from Waynesboro straight to Reed's Gap, home of the Devil's Backbone Brewery. The guy **Pickles** stayed with (her dad's first boss, who just finished a section hike) picked us up at the trail and took us to the brewery. It looked like a restaurants that belonged at Disney. The food was great! I got some French Dip barbecue stuff that really hit the spot. I'm looking forward to the breakfast; it's supposed to be huge.

### Day 93 - August 31
---

The breakfast lived up to expectations, so we got a late start out of the brewery this morning. They shuttled us back to the trail in a the back of a pick-up truck. **Nature Boy** was extatic about riding in the bed "just like in movies." The end of the day was a huge climb straight up The Priest. It wasn't steep, but it was four straight miles of climbing. Once we got to the shelter at the top we read the log book, which hikers have turned into somthing of a confessional, displaying all of their trail sins. Most of them were comedic, but there was a handful of actually terrible ones.

### Day 94 September 1
---

My friends abandoned me! It was raining hard all day and I reached the shelter we'd decided to stay when I found out that thw rest of the group had gone in to town to stay in a motel. Apparently they were wet and cold or something. I did my best to snuggle up in the shelter and ate for about four hours.

### Day 95 September 2

Everything is still soaked from yesterday, but at least it's foggy instead of rainy now. My pack was nice and light since I ate all my food yesterday, but going into Glasgow to resupply was a pain. It took a long time to hitch in and once I got food and ate it was almost 7:30. I had to get a shuttle back to the trail; I think I got ripped off. I did meet up with my squad again at the shelter and was pretty happy eating my Italian Sub from town while everyone else cooked.

### Day 96-97 - September 3-4
---

To be blunt, it's been too long for me to remember anything about these uneventful days.

Today was a crazy saga of hiking. We went into Daleville, resupplied and ate at a Bojangles and a local barbecue place. (They didn't give us the free dessert that their AWOL entry claims because it "isn't hiker season." We had a table of eight hikers.) Then, we hiked up to Tinker Cliffs to try to catch the sunset. It was overcast, so the view wasn't particularly spectacular. After sunset (Yes, in the dark) we hiked four miles to the next shelter to grab some sleep before waking up in time to hike another mile to see the sunrise at McAfee Knob (*The* AT picture spot). I am not at all a fan of the whole headlamping thing. Also, hot take: sleep is pretty great too. We did get some nice photos on the Knob even though it was smilarly overcast and chillingly windy.
