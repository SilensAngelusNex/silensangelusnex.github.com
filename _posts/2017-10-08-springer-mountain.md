### Day 123 - September 30
---

This was the most disappointing trip into town so far. The guidebook said that Gatlinburg has a lot of services; it failed to mention that none of them were useful to throughhikers. It was like trying to do grocery shopping at Disney. There were no shortage of indoor mini-golf funhouse combos or Davy Crockett themed breakfast restaurants with twenty minute waits, but nary a grocery in sight. The one place with any kind of selection has about as much variety as a big gas station and was obscenely expensive. $1.29 for a single ramen anyone? We ended up resupplying at a tobacco shop, where the ramen was at least a bit more reasonable. The whole resupply was ramen, honey buns, and Clif Bars. Fortunately, we can go into Fontana Village tomorrow night, so hopefully they'll have real food. The Five Guys here does somewhat mitigate the resupply disappointment. I devoured two double cheeseburgers and fries; the grease is glorious. Getting out of town after lunch was a bit difficult, but we got a great hitch from a car full of women who work together on vacation. They only had one open seat, but **Nature Boy** and **Dancing Bear** both crammed in the trunk. The whole ride up back into the Smokies was a riot. The rest of the day was pretty relaxed, even though the burgers in my stomach weighed me down. I took the short side-trail up to the summit of Clingman's Dome (the highest point on the AT), but the lookout tower is closed for construction and the summit is tree-covered, so no view. Tonight's shelter was another full one, but it should be the last night of that.

Ugh, I hate Gatlinburg even more now. I only ate two of the three ramens I packed out because they just tasted ...off, and I couldn't bring myself to eat a third one. I was sluggish this morning, probably because I ate half the calories I should have for dinner, and most of the Clif Bars taste abnormal as well. I checked the package: they are expired. I was not aware that could happen. Today's hike out of the Smokies was a pretty one, though. The weekend and day hikers thinned out a bit too. It seems like we're in a less travelled part of the park. We left the park and went over Fontana Dam, then got a ride into town, down to *their* general store. They're no Kroger, but were at least geared towards people camping, (The whole town is kind of an outdoor resort with cabins and stuff.) so the resupply was much better. After **Nature Boy** and I ate dinner in town, we got a ride back up to the trail and stayed at the shelter right next to road. It's nicknamed the Fontana Hilton; it's right next to some bathrooms with running water and showers, a solar charging station, and a view of the lake. The shelter itself is a huge two-floor deal.

Today's climb out of the Fontana Dam valley was nothing to sniff at, but after that, the hiking was smooth until the end of the day, when I climbed up Cheoah Bald. I'm glad to be out of the Smokies; it somehow feels less constrictive outside the big state parks. Maybe I'm just imagining differences that aren't there. We're getting into sections of trail that burned in a forest fire recently (last year I think), which causes some drastic and interesting changes in forest vegetation. It's amazing how charred some of the trees can be and still live. For some reason, when I got in to the shelter tonight, there were a ton of people there, but they all were camping. It wasn't a group or anything, so I'm fairly baffled, but I did get the shelter all to myself.

The first thing we did this morning was hike down into the Nantahala Outdoor Center. We raided their hiker box, **Dancing Bear** tried to get his shoes replaced (no dice), and we got some sherpa rice at their restaurant. Mmmm, veggies. The hike out of the Nantahala river valley is the last real uphill climb on the trail. Everything from here out is only 1k feet or so. (This one's around 2.5k.) The views at the top of the climb were great, though fire damage is increasingly prevalent; I'll try to get a picture of the trail that does a good job showing it.

Starting out today there was a cool stone tower on top of Wayah Bald. The view up there this morning was great, too; I wish I had stayed up there rather than at the shelter last night. **Dancing Bear** left **Nature Boy** and I today to head into Franklin. He's going to wait for a friend there and then start hiking the last section with him. **Dancing Bear** says he'll probably slow down a lot. **Nature Boy** and I have places to be. We did 28 mi today. The Albert Mountain fire tower that we passed close to the end of the day had a great view, but it (and most of the fire towers recently) was locked, so I couldn't go all the way up.

### Day 128 - October 5
---

Today was our last day in North Carolina and our last time above 5k ft on Standing Indian Mountain. The trail was a mess for the last ten or so miles in NC, mostly because of the number of downed trees. It's bad enough when you have to break your rhythm to climb over a tree trunk, but many of them were trees with a mess of branches or trees that had fallen directly on top of the trail, parallel to it, which made them slower to traverse. The condition immediately changed for the better once we crossed over the state line. We stayed to the Top of Georgia Hostel. I was fairly frustrated that they didn't shuttle us into town for free like their guidebook entry advertises (we missed the 4:30 shuttle since we were, you know, hiking), especially since that meant we didn't get to resupply at a grocery store (again) and there was no one else there until later that night. At least we'll get a shuttle for the half-mile back to the trail tomorrow morning.

### Day 129 - October 6
---

The shuttle got us off to an early start this morning, so we were able to really crank out some miles. Before leaving, the hostel was trying to sell us on a pickup 17 miles south; we reached almost before noon. **Nature Boy** decided that he should hike at least one 30+ mile day on the trail, so we did 31. I was dragging pretty hard by the end. Since the shelter near where we wanted to stop was 1.2 mi off the trail, we camped at a spring a ways before it. I'm carrying a ton of food for these past few days, so I spent a long time eating. I had one ramen, two servings of Mountain House, and a rice side.

### Day 130 - October 7
---

It rained all night last night, so my tent's all wet and heavy now. I've had the worst luck with camping. I've had *maybe* twenty nights of rain on this whole trip and I swear I've been camping during half of them. I didn't wake up this morning until **Nature Boy** said something to me as he was leaving the campsite. If I'd been by myself, I might have just stayed in the tent all day. It was pretty foggy and miserable out. We went over Blood Mountain today which was absolutely thick with tourists. I'm not sure why all these people are out here when there's no view and they're getting wet. I'm pretty salty about it, honestly. At least today we're only doing low twenties. Yesterday *hurt*.

### Day 131 - October 8

The fury of the heavens is unleashed! It started raining early this morning, slowing down to a sprinkle by the time I left the shelter. **Nature Boy** and I had decided to meet up for a food break at the second to last shelter, which was 13 mi away. Before long, I was considering taking my rain jacket off since it wasn't raining hard enough to really get wet. Maybe five minutes before I made it to the shelter (ie. after **Nature Boy** was there already), it started raining buckets. The trail turned into a very long puddle about an inch deep. Good stuff. After eating, the rain and wind died down to reasonable levels, but it was still bad enough that we still got soaked on the way up to the summit. Nate and my parents met up with us before we started on the last stretch, so they hiked the last three miles right after us. **Nature Boy** and I basically ran up the rest of the way. The view there wasn't great (trees and fog), but there were *two* plaques. **Nature Boy** did a couple of triumphant yells standing on the highest part of the summit, which brought some guys staying at the nearby shelter running up the trail with a first-aid kit to see if he was okay. Anyway, after my family got up there, we took some pictures and went back to the car. Time for a warm, dry bed, some food that's never been dried, and the best part: no mileage goal for tomorrow.
