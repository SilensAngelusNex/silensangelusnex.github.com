Dad and I just got in to Millinocket, which is about an hour away from the trailhead for Katahdin. We're staying at the [Appalachian Trail Lodge](appalachiantraillodge.com/). There's only a couple other people here now; a bunch come in tomorrow to start on June 1. My plan so far is to leave for the trail at 6:30 (!) and start the hike by 8. If we aren't most of the way to the top by noon, Dad's going to start heading back so he doesn't miss the bus back to town and I'll camp in Baxter State Park. If we're fast, we'll both come back to the lodge and I'll go back to the trail with all the June 1st people.

It's supposed to rain tomorrow and there's apparently a lot of bouldering on the way to the top, so it might be kind of a mess. Should be fun.
