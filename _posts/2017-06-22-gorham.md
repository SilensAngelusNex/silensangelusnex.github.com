Whew, finally through Maine! I'm staying at the [White Mountains Lodge & Hostel](https://www.whitemountainslodgeandhostel.com) in Gorham.

This last section, Rangeley to Gorham, is one of the harder ones on the trail. It's got some pretty big climbs, like the 3000 ft. climb over 2.5 miles to summit Old Speck, but the most infamous section is the Mahoosuc Notch, which holds the distinction of "Most difficult mile on the AT." I deviated from the schedule I posted in Rangeley so that I'd only have a 12 mile day when I went through the Notch. I'm glad I did.

I wouldn't say the Notch was the hardest mile of the *trail*. There wasn't really much of a trail the whole way though. It seemed like someone had said "Well, there's a boulder field here; it'd be no fun if we marked that. They'll know they're done when there's a trail again." The two pieces of advice I got beforehand (from NOBOs) were "stow your trekking poles" and "if you can go high or low, go high." The first nugget of wisdom was great; there were so many good handholds at eye level and above. The second I think I followed a bit overzealously and it got me into a few tight spots. Trying to pull yourself and thirty extra pounds up with just your arms is hard, even just on an incline. Also, there were some people who said you had to take you pack off at some parts to go under boulders. I didn't do that. It was tight.

When I first started that section, it had just stared to rain, which made some of the footholds problematic. The rain let up after I was about a third of the way through, but all the rocks were still damp. The lower parts of the Notch were chilly (there was still ice and snow in some of the crevasses) so once the sun came out, it shone through the billowing mist from the rain, which was awesome-looking.

I had some similarly bad luck with rain the day before, when I was climbing Baldpate. No sooner had I gotten to the exposed portion near the top than the wind started gusting and rain started whipping around. I heard some thunder in the distance, so I spent the next half hour trying to go as fast as I could while staying as close as possible to anything taller that I am. Thankfully, I didn't actually see any lightning. Anyway, no pictures from the summit on that one.

My shoes, my shoes! Why have you forsaken me? I didn't realize how tough this terrain was going to be on them or I would have asked my parents to mail me replacements in Rangeley. They're so holey right now that I'm expecting someone from the Vatican to come try to canonize them, but I'm afraid they might not have soles by then. They both have rips down both sides from the ball of my foot to about the middle of my arch. The only thing holding them together might be the stanky alpine mud that's inured them. I'm ecstatic to have another pair in my mail drop. Clean, dry, and the only hole the one where your foot goes. Such luxury.

I've been rolling with a group of three other just-graduated guys from the Carolinas, so I'll probably just stay with them through the Whites or until Dad shows up to do a section with me. Shelters get kind of weird up ahead because there are all these $100/night hiker huts. You can work for stay, where you do dishes and clean in the evening and morning in exchange for sleeping inside and food, but they normally only let a few people work for stay per night. Some of the NOBOs said that the huts will give you leftover food (because they have to pack out all their trash) if you get there at the right time, so we'll probably have some fun scheduling when in the day to hit them. That said, I have a ton of food. I went to town at Wal-Mart. Sandy would be proud of what I cooked on the Hostel's grill tonight.

I'm a little scared of all the food weight I'm going to be carrying for the next bit. If it's bad, I'll start eating a lot more, which makes me kind of hope it's bad. I doubled my ration on Poptarts and protein bars, added some snacks, and upgraded every instant mashed potato dinner into a ramenbomb. (Make ramen, eat noodles, reheat the broth, then pour in the instant mash.) I ditched the Knorr sides because 7 minutes of boiling is a pain, clean-up is hard, and they take up more space. I also picked up some butter and cheese, so I'll see how that works out.

Next stop is Lincoln, which should be about 6 days from now. The terrain should be pretty tough; we start going through the Presidential range. The old man chickened out of the Gorham meet up we had planned, (The "excuse" was something about the airport closed for an unsafe runway?) so now hes planning on coming to the trail two days before we hit Lincoln. It's probably for the best that he get a little taste of the trail with an immediate chance to resupply and change gear, food, etc. if necessary.
