Took a chill zero day in Norwich, VT that was more like a 5 mile day from all the walking I did around Hanover. I stayed with one of the trail angels on the list who was right near where the trail returns to the woods. It was a bit of a bummer to be in town on the 4th when everything is closed, but I found a really cool Indian restaurant for dinner and got some gelato afterwards. Time to leave New Hampshire and get started on Vermud ...ahem... *Vermont*.

### Day 36 - July 5

I had a field day today, as in about half of the hike was through fields instead of the woods. I do not enjoy the whole "direct sunlight" phenomena, especially when I'm already sweating from the hills. **The Settlers of Katahdin** met back up with me at the Thistle Hill shelter. The next few days seem like they're going to be a bit weird because of awkward shelter placement.

### Day 37 - July 6

Today was another pretty low mileage day at 12. I'm dragging a little. **The Settlers** went on to the next shelter 2 miles ahead , but the book says there's no water source there and I didn't want to deal with that. We're starting to encounter a lot of NOBOs ; they're a little intimidating. I hope I'm going to be able to out in the kind of miles they're doing when I get down south.

### Day 38 - July 7

Or maybe I'll just do those kind of miles now. My options for today's hike we're 10 or 22 miles if I wanted to end at a shelter. I did 22, 1/100th of the trail. I thought about stopping at Rt 4 because there's this [hostel/deli/cult]() I want to go to, but it was late by the time I got to the road. I'll hit it when I got into Rutland at Rt 103. Since it should only take a day and a half to get there, I ate two days of dinners tonight. Also, I lost **The Settlers** again. I think they went into town.

### Day 39 - July 8

I went over Killington today. It was a pretty big climb, but the mountain was shrouded in mist when I got to the top, so I didn't really get any view. The restaurant (at the ski lodge) on top of the mountain was closed when I got to the top so no overpriced hamburger for me. It started raining on the way down the mountain so I waited it out a little at a shelter. I stayed pretty dry and caught some of the ukulele music that one of the guys in the shelter was playing.

### Day 40 - July 9

The hike into Rutland was only about a mile on the trail. I got a hitch into town (that took awhile) and hit up the Wal-Mart to get a replacement for my newly-broken water filter and enough food to get me to Manchester Center. Right now I'm in the Yellow Deli, stopping to get food, post, and get everything ready for the trail again. Hopefully it's easier to hitch back out of town than it was hitching in.
