I didn't post in Stratton because I was too lazy, so this is a long one.

The rain convinced me to stop in town instead of pushing on towards Gorham. I think I would have had to resupply anyway, so that probably worked out well. Yesterday was a huge 19-mile day over the Saddlebacks. I hear the 3-mile portion above treeline has really pretty views. I wouldn't know, since for me it was three miles of wind that almost blew me over with lots of rain in it that may or may not have had some hail mixed in. So yeah, afterwards I wanted a bed and to throw all my clothes in a dryer, even though my raingear did a pretty good job. All the precipitation means no pics from that day, even if there had been anything to see.

The few days before yesterday were fantastic. The weather was clear and decently cool; there weren't any 90F days like there were a while ago. The mountains were huge. There were a handful of climbing sections that I was really glad to be climbing up instead of down. I'm just going to rapid-fire pictures, since up-and-down pretty adequately describes the last few days. If you haven't discovered it already, you can mouse-over the pictures for descriptions.

The Crocker Mountains and Sugarloaf were pretty frustrating because there weren't really views at the top. They were a lot of work without a big moment for that sweet sense of achievement. The day after I went over them, the trail went over the shoulder of Spaulding Mountain. There was a side trail that the sign said was 150 meters up to the summit. Starved for views as I was, I dropped my pack, flew up to rocky path and saw... trees.

My shoes continue to.deteriorate, but I'll be able to keep them together to Gorham. There's some more big mountains comming up, but the guys I've been with for the past three days and I have been cranking through the miles even with the terrain the last few days. Here's the current plan to get through Maine and.into Gorham.
