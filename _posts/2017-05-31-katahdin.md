Dad and I hiked up Katahdin today, so I guess thats 5.2 down, 2184.6 to go. The climb was less of a hike and more of a long, steep, rock scramble; I was surprised at how technical it was. There was a blaze just about every other rock so you didn't go up the wrong way. Unfortunately, there was some thick fog near the top, so we only got glimpses of the panoramic view. Though, the fog did make the whole thing pretty surreal.

We met a guy from near Lancaster who just finished his NOBO hike with his climb today; he started way back in January. I would not want to have to deal with the snow like he did when he was hiking through the northeast.

Tomorrow I've got about 13 miles to the next shelter, then the next day I'll get a last change to resupply before I get into the "100 mile wilderness." I probably won't be able to post anything until after I get through that, and once I do I'm going to have to find a way to post with my phone instead of the computer. Don't let me down, Github.
