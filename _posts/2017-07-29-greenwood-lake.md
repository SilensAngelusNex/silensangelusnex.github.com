Wow, it's been a long time since I posted last. There weren't many good towns to head into between here and Sheffield, but there have be a handful of delis, which have been decent for resupply. Unfortunately, none of those had public computers.

### Day 51 - July 20

Jess Treat, the owner of the hostel I stayed at last night, gave me and the two other guests a great breakfast before we headed out. Eggs, toast, tea, yogurt, granola, the works. We got started a little late though, and it was HOT. There were a couple of swampy sections today by the Housatonic where the mosquitoes were terrible; I looked back a few times while I was walking and saw a cloud of at least twenty coming after me. Once I crossed into Connecticut and made it to the shelter (Riga), I met **Goldfinger** who's also going SOBO. He's another guy who just graduated college out here hiking and postponing real life. We also met a guy who said he was a felon doing a section hike who told us about all the drugs he used to do. Anyway, that's another state down.

### Day 52 - July 21

**Goldfinger** and I walked into Salisbury today to hit up their grocery. He had to resupply and I wanted to pick up some extra protein and some fruit. The 0.8 mi walk into town was on a shaded, gravel bike path, which was a nice change from the AT. After Salisbury, there was a long, flat walk along the Housatonic and past some falls before the hills started again. A weird humming noise started with the hills. It grew steadily louder until I was asking myself where the closest Nascar track to the AT is. Four miles of engine noise later, I looked down off the ridge through a gap in the trees and, sure enough, there were cars zipping around a racetrack a mile or two down the hill. I love the peace and quiet we get out here.

Today had a walk along the river about twice as long as the one yesterday. I was pretty relaxing, if a bit buggy. After that, I went up the St. John's Ledges, which were about as stark a contrast with the river walk as possible. They were super steep, decently technical, and once I gained a little altitude, the bugs went away entirely. I stopped at the Mt. Algo Shelter tonight so I could easily resupply in Kent tomorrow morning, but **Goldfinger** pushed on another eight miles.

Again I happen upon my archnemesis: Sunday. Kent has a library, but not on Sunday. Kent has restaurants that open before eleven; not on Sunday. I did get everything I needed (except for posting), but I did have to wait a little long than I wanted. Unrelatedly, Kent is hilariously preppy, with a small side of motorcycles. I felt like I was going to get pulled over for not wearing a polo. Their grocery store was too fancy to stock instamash, so I had to pick up some rice sides instead. I also got some [Lapsang Souchong](https://www.twiningsusa.com/our-products/our-products/lapsang-souchong/tea-bags-20ct--box) tea to try, since I was running low on teabags. It's really strong. After leaving town around one, I did a frantic twelve miles to get to the shelter after the one where **Goldfinger** presumably stayed last night.

It rained hard this morning; my tent is soaked. Thankfully, after about an hour of hiking in the rain, it let up and was just cool and a little wind, which is much better than the heat of the last few days. Right after the rain stopped I hit my first deli, [Tony's Deli](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-deli-pawling). The Italian Combo in my belly made the rest of the day pretty enjoyable. I set my tent up with one side off the ground so it will dry out tonight while I sleep in the shelter. There have been oodles of NOBOs at the shelters for the past few days. Most of them camp, but there are normally 10+ at the campsites next to each shelter.

Today I hit deli number 2, [Mountaintop Market Deli](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mountaintop-market-deli-and-catering-stormville). I was a little disappointed that their adjoining pizza place wasn't open that early in the morning. I stayed at [Fahnestock State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/133/hunting.aspx). I didn't get there early enough to stop at their snack bar, but Joe, a Trail Angel who spends every other week camping there all season, fed me dinner and breakfast.

### Day 57 - July 26

Deli number 3! [The Appalachian Market]( https://www.yelp.com/biz/appalachian-market-garrison-3) was my favorite one so far, even though it wasn't in the AWOL guide. Their resupply was much better than the others and their sandwiches were great. I got one sandwich and fries to eat there, then packed another sandwich out for later. I have been a little worried about how much protein I'm getting but I'm certainly not after that. The water has been questionable lately; it's been really iron-y for the past few days, so I guess I don't need to be worried about my iron intake either.

I saw my first (and second) bear today. Around 2AM I heard some rustling and heavy-sounding footsteps around the campsite. I poked my head out to look around and saw... another hiker camped a ways away. Then I saw the bears when I walked through the [zoo](http://www.trailsidezoo.org/). After the zoo, I climbed up bear mountain, which had an immaculately maintained (read: *easy*) trail and a slightly anticlimactic summit, as I'd heard that you can see the NYC skyline, but visibility wasn't quite good enough. I was dragging today so I stopped one shelter early, which had the added bonus of keeping me out of the infamously bear-infested Fingerboard shelter. The trailside berries have been slowimg me down, too. There's an abundance of wild blueberries and wineberries, with some blackberries every once in a while. I've stopped to harvest quite a few wineberry bushes.

It was pretty hot when I started, so I turned my zipoffs into shorts, which I've only done three or four times so far. Within twent minutes of hiking, I got stung by some yellow and black stripey insect right on my ankle. It hurt like hell every time a toom a step for a good half-mile, and my ankle swelled up. The bup got away scott-free, too. Regardless, I made up most of the ground I neglected to do yesterday, spurred on by signs that promised a "Fiesta" just short of the shelter where I planned to stay. It was put on by a group of hikers that hiked together a previous year and had brought tons of chorizo, smoked chicken, tortillas, Spanish rice, beers, and snacks out to a big clearing near a trailhead. I camped there so I wouldn't have to walk a mile and a half after I was full of chorizo, but I regretted it a little at about 2 or 3 in the morning, when these guys were still going hard. I'm glad I've been carrying earplugs.


### Day 60 - July 29

I packed up a little earlier than most of the partiers this morning and headed into Greenwood Lake to resupply. My phone is almost dead (I left it out of Airplane Mode overnight by accident.) so I might be here a while.
