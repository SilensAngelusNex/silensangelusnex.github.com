### Day 47 - July 16

Today I went through Dalton. I got an awesome (and huge) cheesesteak at the sub place in town. Unfortunately, the only the only groceries in town were from gas stations and they didn't have anything good for resupply, so I'm going to have to cook the second packet of Italian soup I got in Manchester Center. They take forever... I also wasn't able to buy any propane canisters, but one of the people in Dalton who does trail magic had a hiker box with some partial cans in it, so I got one that's about a third full to hold me over until I get to the next outfitter or hardware store that carries them. I stayed at the Cookie Lady's house, which was a blueberry and raspberry farm run by an older couple. I mowed some of their grass so I could camp in their yard and bought a couple of fresh eggs for my ramen.

### Day 48 - July 17

For the past few hundred miles, NOBOs have been telling me to make sure I stay at Upper Goose Pond shelter. My day today was short, but I couldn't go past without staying the night. It was great. The caretakers (Caretakers volunteer to work at the shelter for a week.) gave us their dinner leftovers, which included some salad, (Vegetables!) and made us tons of pancakes in the morning. It was well worth the stop and even lived up to the hype.

I went over "Mount" Wilcox today. It was some of the rockiest trail I've seen in a while, (The terrain has really mellowed out since New Hampshire.) but it wasn't too bad. There was a pretty strenuous climb after I passed the Shaker Campsite, but it was only about 900 ft.

Today was just an easy 12mi into Sheffield. It was starting to get pretty hot as I got into town, so I'm glad to be in the cool library, especially since the next few miles are supposed to be through corn fields. I picked up the package with my sorely needed new kicks at the post office. The town is right on the MA-CT border, so I should have one more state out of the way tomorrow.
