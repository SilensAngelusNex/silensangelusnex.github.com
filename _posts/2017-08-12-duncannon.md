### Day 61 - July 30

Today was a decently flat section along the NY-NJ line. There was a 0.8mi section of boardwalk (including the bridge above) that had a lot of dayhikers on it. In fact, there were a lot of dayhikers all day toady; this section must be convenient. I stopped and camped in the Unionville park so I can grab my package as soon as the Post Office opens. I got close to Unionville early, so I pick the last of the handful of road crossings that led into town, but I was still done hiking around 4PM. After setting up my tent, I went into Annabelle's, the pizza place next to the campground and got a huge plate of Chicken Parm and a salad that was supposed to be an entr√©e. It's nice to be full. In the package waiting for me, my parents sent an iPod and a sheet and blanket to use instead of my sleeping bag. (The bag is way warmer than I need it to be and a little heavier than the sheet and blanket.)


### Day 62 - July 31

I'm planning to meet up with my family tomorrow, so I left Unionville with a really heavy pack this morning. I'm going to hand off my sleeping bag when I see them instead of mailing it, so my pack is a good 3-4lbs heavier than it was yesterday. When I was on the top of Sunrise Mountain, some guys who were there shooting stock footage in the park interviewed me. I don't think I was as interesting as they expected. **Sniffles** and John (who we've since dubbed **Halfway** since he made it half-way without a trail name), who were both in Unionville with me, showed up at this shelter too. There were a lot of people camping, but I was the only one staying in the shelter, so I set up my tent in the shelter.

### Day 63 - August 1

So the noises I heard last night that I thought was a bear was almost certainly a bear. John said he saw it nosing around people's tents early in the morning. I met up with my mom and Nate a few miles after the shelter. I had almost gotten down to them when I got a text that they had stopped because they had seen, surprise, surprise, a bear and her cubs. Honestly, I'm pretty salty that I've been out here two months without seeing any interesting animals and they were hiking for 30 minutes and saw three bears. I didn't see these, either. They hiked with me back to their car. Later in the day, Mom dropped off Dad and Julia, who did the last four miles of my hike with me, then we all went back to the cabin where they're staying.

### Day 64 - August 2
---

So the bed convinced me to stay another night. I was planning on going down to Delaware Water Gap today, but I decided to catch up on sleep, Game of Thrones, and Rick and Morty instead. It was a good day to be inside; it thunder stormed all afternoon. I downloaded a few new books for my Kindle, including [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) which both Nate and Julia are now reading voraciously.

### Day 65 - August 3
---

Dad and I hiked the 14mi to the New Jersey side of Delaware Water Gap, then he drove across the Delaware while the rest of the family joined me for the walk over the bridge. I forgot my water bottles in the car, so Dad and I had to make do with carrying only one liter. It was hot so we had to stop at almost every water source to filter water. I'm going to stay with them in the cabin one more night before they go home and I start truckin' again.

### Day 66 - August 4
---

The rocks have started. Today the trail went over little rock, big rocks, Wolf Rocks, any kind of rocks you can think of. It has been flattish since the trail is mostly ridge-walking, but it's hard to take advantage of the easy grade to make good time when you have to pay attention to where you place your foot each step. I'm really glad the rocks are all dry right now; the big ones are a pain to scramble over when they're slippery.

### Day 67 - August 5

Today was even more uneventful than yesterday. The whole day was along the ridge until the very end, when I climbed down then up Lehigh Gap. There was a significant portion where the real AT was closed of (for reforestation), which was nice because the detour was a flat gravel path. It was a very welcome break from the rocks.

### Day 68 - August 6
---

![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Trail_blaze-symbols.svg "Different blazes on the AT")

I've been holding this in for a while but I really need to rant about the trail blazes. Double blazes (one directly over the other) means that there's a turn. They are not "single blazes but better." They don't go where it looks like the trail *would* turn but it actually goes straight. They *certainly* don't go right before a four way intersection that the AT goes straight through. Also, the double blazes that indicate a direction (with the top blaze offset to the direction of the turn) should *not* say that both NOBOs and SOBOs the same direction. If they need to make a right to stay on the trail, I need to make a left. I really want to buy paint to make some of these more clear, but I don't have any way of knowing if I'm actually right until I see the next blaze. It was particularly bad today because the blazes were sparser than usual and it was drizzling all day, so visibility wasn't great. I had to pull out [Guthook](http://www.guthookhikes.com/2013/03/guthooks-guide-to-appalachian-trail.html) a few times to make sure I was going the right way.

### Day 69 - August 7
---

Today I stopped in to Port Clinton to resupply. The nearby Cabela's gives free shuttles to and from the campground in town and they're right near the Wal-Mart, so I took advantage of that. I would have gotten something from Cabela's but I'm not really in the market for hunting rifles or jerky making machines right now so... I also stopped by the Five Guy nearby for the nice, greasy cheeseburgers I've been craving. I also got some peaches and cherries to eat back at the campground and munched on them while one of the NOBOs there talked to me (at me?) about all the trail gossip: where people he knew were now, what they were carrying, how bad The Doyle is, etc. I'm going to start early tomorrow so I can get to the 501 shelter in the afternoon. It's 24 miles from here.

### Day 70 - August 8

I still had a decent amount of fruit left over to eat this morning, so my pack was heavy for a while into the hike. The iPod really helped me make the miles today. I ended up getting to the 501 around 5PM, an hour an a half before I'd said I'd meet Eddie there. He drove some absurd distance to come out to see me for a few hours, hang out at the shelter, and bring me some food. The shelter's caretaker was a bit reluctant to let a non-hiker back there, but there were few enough people staying the night that he said it was okay. It was, as always, great to get some real food (meat and vegetables!) for a change.

### Day 71 - August 9

Eddie kept me up talking later than I have been getting to bed and between that and the 24 miles, I got an incredibly late start today. The day was a shorter one, but it was still long enough that I got in to the shelter when the sun was going down. I did pick up a pack of ramen from a box of trail magic, so I had 1.5 rations tonight, two ramens and a Knorr rice side. The shelter was nice, with a spring not ten feet away. However, I did have something making noises out in the darkness. In the morning when I went to grab my trekking poles to leave, the foam handles were all chewed up. I guess a mouse or something went after the sweat in them.

I'm really underestimating these "short" days. I did 18mi today, which I was thinking of as "way less than 24." It's not *that* much less. The shelter is great, though. When I was talking to a Ridgerunner there about his section (Duncannon to Lehigh Gap), **Sniffles** rolled up, just finishing he day of 30+ miles. We're planning on staying at the same places for the next few days, so it'll be nice to have some company. The one bad thing about the shelter is that it's way far down the hill. **Sniffles** was joking that he's now done the four hardest sections of the AT: southern Maine, the Whites, the rocks of Pennsylvania, and the trail to that spring. I used so much water cooking dinner that I had to go down twice. *Ugh*.

### Day 73 - August 11

I did the short hike into Duncannon today. I'm staying at a [church](http://www.duncannonag.com/) that let's the hikers use their basement for free that I've been hearing about from NOBOs for about 400 miles. When I came back to the church after resupplying and doing laundry, I saw **Moose**, formerly Matt, come into town. I haven't seen him since Monson! **Sniffles** and a few NOBOs are here as well. The pastor of the church grilled hot dogs ad hamburgers for all of us, so we couldn't be happier.

### Day 74 - August 12
---

Today I'm going to roll out of Duncannon up to the next shelter with **Sniffles**. It's only 11mi away but the guidebook says there's no camping for the 18mi after it.
