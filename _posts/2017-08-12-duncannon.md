### Day 61 - July 30

Today was a decently flat section along the NY-NJ line. There was a 0.8mi section of boardwalk (including the bridge above) that had a lot of dayhikers on it. In fact, there were a lot of dayhikers all day toady; this section must be convienient. I stopped and camped in the Unionville park so I can grab my package as soon as the Post Office opens. I got close to Unionville early, so I pick the last of the handful of road crossings that led into town, but I was still done hiking around 4PM. After setting up my tent, I went into Annabelle's, the pizza place next to the campground and got a huge plate of Chicken Parm and a salad that was supposed to be an entree. It's nice to be full. In the package waiting for me, my parents sent an iPod and a sheet and blanket to use instead of my sleeping bag. (The bag is way warmer than I need it to be and a little heavier than the sheet and blanket.)

I'm planning to meet up with my family tomorrow, so I left Unionville with a really heavy pack this morning. I'm going to hand off my sleeping bag when I see them instead of mailing it, so my pack is a good 3-4lbs heavier than it was yesterday. When I was on the top of Sunrise Mountain, some guys who were there shooting stock footage in the park interviewed me. I don't think I was as interesting as they expected. **Sniffles** and John (who we've since dubbed **Halfway** since he made it half-way without a trail name), who were both in Unionville with me, showed up at this shelter too. There were a lot of people camping, but I was the only one staying in the shelter, so I set up my tent in the shelter.

So the noises I heard last night that I thought was a bear was almost certainly a bear. John said he saw it nosing arround people's tents early in the morning. I met up with my mom and Nate a few miles after the shelter. I had almost gotten down to them when I got a text that they had stopped because they had seen, surprise, surprise, a bear and her cubs. Honestly, I'm pretty salty that I've been out here two months without seeing any interesting animals and they were hiking for 30 minutes and saw three bears. I didn't see these, either. They hiked with me back to their car. Later in the day, Mom dropped off Dad and Julia, who did the last four miles of my hike with me, then we all went back to the cabin where they're staying.

### Day 64 - August 2
---

So the bed convinced me to stay another night. I was planning on going down to Deleware Water Gap today, but I decided to catch up on sleep, Game of Thrones, and Rick and Morty instead. It was a good day to be inside; it thunder stormed all afternoon. I downloaded a few new books for my Kindle, including [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) which both Nate and Julia are now reading voraciously. 

### Day 65 - August 3
---

Dad and I hiked the 14mi to the New Jersey side of Deleware Water Gap, then he drove across the Deleware while the rest of the family joined me for the walk over the bridge. I forgot my waterbottles in the car, so Dad and I had to make do with carrying only one liter. It was hot so we had to stop at almost every water source to filter water. I'm going to stay with them in the cabin one more night before they go home and I start truckin' again.

I'm really underestimating these "short" days. I did 18mi today, which I was thinking of as "way less than 24." It's not *that* much less. The shelter is great, though. When I was talking to a Ridgerunner there about his section (Duncannon to Lehiegh Gap), Sniffles rolled up, just finishing he day of 30+ miles. We're planning on staying at the same places for the next few days, so it'll be nice to have some company. The one bad thing about the shelter is that it's way far down the hill. **Sniffles** was joking that he's now done the four hardest sections of the AT: southern Maine, the Whites, the rocks of Pennsylvania, and the trail to that spring. I used so much water cooking dinner that I had to go down twice. *Ugh*.

I did the short hike into Duncannon today. I'm staying at a [church](http://www.duncannonag.com/) that let's the hikers use their basement for free that I've been hearing about from NOBOs for about 400 miles. When I came back to the church after resupplying and doing laundry, I saw **Moose**, formerly Matt, come into town. I haven't seen him since Monson! **Sniffles** and a few NOBOs are here as well. The pastor of the church grilled hot dogs ad hamburgers for all of us, so we couldn't be happier.
